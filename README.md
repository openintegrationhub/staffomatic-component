## Authorization

Each request to Snazzy Contacts API requires an authorization. You have to pass your token as a `Bearer` token in headers.

## Actions and triggers

The **adapter** supports the following **actions** and **triggers**:

#### Triggers:

- Get persons - polling (`getPersonsPolling.js`)
- Get organizations - polling (`getOrganizationsPolling.js`)

All triggers are of type '_polling'_ which means that the **trigger** will be scheduled to execute periodically. It will fetch only these objects from the database that have been modified or created since the previous execution. Then it will emit one message per object that changes or is added since the last polling interval. For this case at the very beginning we just create an empty `snapshot` object. Later on we attach `lastUpdated` to it. At the end the entire object should be emitted as the message body.

#### Actions:

- Upsert person (`upsertPerson.js`)
- Upsert organization(`upsertOrganization.js`)

In each trigger and action, before sending a request we get the token from [Snazzy Contacts](https://snazzycontacts.com) via calling the function `getToken()` from `snazzy.js` file, which is located in directory **utils**. This function returns a token which is used when we send a request to
[Snazzy Contacts](https://snazzycontacts.com).

##### Get persons

Get persons trigger (`getPersonsPolling.js`) performs a request which fetch all persons saved by a user in [Snazzy Contacts](https://snazzycontacts.com).

##### Get organizations

Get organizations trigger (`getOrganizationsPolling.js`) performs a request which fetch all organizations saved by a user in [Snazzy Contacts](https://snazzycontacts.com).

##### Upsert person

Upsert person action (`upsertPerson.js`) updates an existing person if it already exists. Otherwise it creates a new one.

##### Upsert organization

Upsert organization action (`upsertOrganization.js`) updates an existing organization if it already exists. Otherwise it creates a new one.
